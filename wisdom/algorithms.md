# Problem Solving Patterns

1) If the given input is sorted (array, list, or matrix), then we will use a variation of Binary Search or a Two Pointers strategy.
2) If weâ€™re dealing with top/maximum/minimum/closest k elements among n elements, we will use a Heap.
3) If we need to try all combinations (or permutations) of the input, we can either use recursive Backtracking or iterative Breadth-First Search.
